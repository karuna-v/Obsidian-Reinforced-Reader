# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is a sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

IN PROGRESS

This is an Obsidian plugin that creates a "daily recall" system - it randomly selects a note from a folder and generates a summary, then saves it to a recall.md file. The content is also optionally emailed to you every day. Previous summaries are not saved.
